  # Installation

Available for download via the GitHub repository, and available for viewing and use via heroku [here](https://take-note-of-that.herokuapp.com/). The app should be completely deployed via heroku, and is nearly self-explanatory. The user can add notes, view previously saved notes, and edit them via the notes page.

  

  # Usage 

Save, view and edit previous notes. This app stores the notes remotely so even if your laptop is completely destroyed in some sort of nuclear cataclysm you notes will be safe. Unfortunately, this is speaking theoretically. While all required features function locally a heroku deployment throws errors. This will be resolved in future patches.
